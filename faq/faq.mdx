  <Accordion title="What is WebAuthN and why is it used by Futurfolio?">
    
    WebAuthn, short for Web Authentication, is a web standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the FIDO Alliance. It's designed to provide a more secure and user-friendly way to authenticate users to web-based applications and services [https://webauthn.io/].

    <b>Here are some key points about WebAuthn:</b>

    <li>Passwordless Authentication: WebAuthn enables strong authentication using public-key cryptography, which means you can log in without needing a traditional password. Instead, it uses methods like biometrics (fingerprints or facial recognition) or hardware tokens (like a YubiKey).</li>

    <li>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): It supports multi-factor authentication by combining something you are (biometric ID) and something you have (your device).</li>

    <li>Security: WebAuthn is resistant to phishing attacks and doesn't require passwords, which are often vulnerable to theft and hacking.</li>

    <li>Compatibility: It's supported by major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari, and is widely adopted by services like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft.</li>
